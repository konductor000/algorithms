## My Projects

#### This is a short summary of my projects available on github


## ML projects

- [Quora-question-pair](https://github.com/konductor000/quora_questions_pairs). In this project I fine-tuned BERT model on quora question pairs dataset, to solve sentence simmilarity task. I also implemented searching engine, in order, to quickly find top k most simmilar questions to a given one, using sentence embeddings simmilarity.

- [Style-transfer](https://github.com/konductor000/Style-transfer-BERT). Here I fine-tuned and used 2 MLM BERTs, to change the style of the sequence e.g. convert negative feedback to positive.

- [Domane-adaptation](https://github.com/konductor000/Domane-adaptation). I took BERT model and 2 different datasets for one task (NER) and fine-tuned model using different methods to choose which one is better.

- [Summarizer-bot](https://github.com/konductor000/Summarizer-bot). In this project I made a telegram bot, that can summarize text and answer questions about this text.

## Non ML projects

- [Graph-draw](https://github.com/konductor000/GraphDraw). This programm alows you to visualize graphs. The goal is to draw a graph that will be good-looking for a person (fewer edge intersections - better).

- [Chess](https://github.com/konductor000/chess). The implementation of the chess game. The program obeys the rules of chess, you cannot make an illegal move.

- [Algorithms](https://github.com/konductor000/algorithms). The collection of algorithms and data structures that I implemented.
